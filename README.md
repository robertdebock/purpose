# Purpose

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/purpose.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/purpose)

```
Create playgounds for everybody
```

# Reasoning

When people get freedom to `play`, there is a chance that something beautiful is created. A playground is a safe area where people can experiment, meet others and develop a `gem`. (`gem`: Something magically creative, a spark that fuels improvement.)
The `everybody` part refers to not specifically me, but all people. It suggestes an inclusive environment without discrimination.
