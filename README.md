# Purpose

```
Create playgounds for everybody
```

# Reasoning

When people get freedom to `play`, there is a chance that something beautiful is created. A playground is a safe area where people can experiment, meet others and develop a `gem`. (`gem`: Something magically creative, a spark that fuels improvement.)
